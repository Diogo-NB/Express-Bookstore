# Express Bookstore

This repository contains a fake bookstore website I'm currently developing while learning the Express framework for Node.js.

# Description

The project is a simple web application that allows users to view, add, update, and delete books in a bookstore. The backend handles the business logic and data management, and serves dynamic web pages using EJS templates.
