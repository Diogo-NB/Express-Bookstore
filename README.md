# Express Fake Store 

This repository contains a fake store website I'm currently developing while learning the Express framework for Node.js.

# Description

The project is a simple web application that allows end users to browse, add to cart and checkout products, while admins add, update, and delete products in the store. The Node.js backend handles the business logic and data management, and serves dynamic web pages using EJS templates.
